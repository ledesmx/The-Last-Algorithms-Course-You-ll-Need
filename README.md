# the-last-algorithms-course-you-ll-need

A repository of data structures & algorithms based on ThePrimeagen's [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)

## What I Learned

- I learned about Big O Time Complexity and its importance in understanding algorithms.
- How to compose different data structures to take advantage of his capabilities, such as the LRU cache, which uses a linked list and a map.
- Now I understand why data structures are so important and how powerful they are.
- I developed this project using Test-Driven Development (TDD) along with the Jest-like test library built-in Bun.

## Project Structure

- search - Linear search, binary search, and two crystal balls problem
- sort - Bubble sort, linked list, queue, and stack
- arrays - Array list and array buffer
- recursion - Maze solver
- quicksort - Quick sort
- trees - Tree traversals
- tree_search - Binary Search Tree, binary tree comparison, and Breadth-First Search
- heap - Min heap and tries
- graphs - BFS with adjacency matrix, DFS with adjacency list, and Dijkstras shortest path
- maps_and_lru - LRU cache implemented with map and doubly linked list

## Install and Test

Be sure to have installed [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
